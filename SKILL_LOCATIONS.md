# Where skills live, and why

Settled 2026-08-29 after a reconciliation across every location.
At that point every duplicated skill was byte-identical, so nothing
was overwritten and no version was lost.

## Here — `skills/`

Every skill used interactively. `~/.claude/skills` is a symlink to this
directory, so editing through `~/.claude/skills` edits the repo.
Commit and push to update every machine.

## Not here — `kvond/scheduled-runs`

Thirteen job definitions, each with its own SKILL.md: aihs-update,
answerable-nightly-distill, author-block, book-ops-inventory-rebuild,
book-ops-monthly-full-sweep, daily-brief-v2, daily-spanish-lesson,
learning-block-agenda, overnight-book-graph-build, second-brain-distill,
sunday-weekly-sweep, tags-pages-sweep, wilmu-update.

They stay there because the scheduler reads them from that repo. Moving
them would break running jobs for no benefit.

## Not here — `kvond/Answerable-Teaching`

The book publishing pipeline: book-compile, scripts, source, writing,
nightly-publish.sh, and com.kvond.answerable-publish.plist. It contains
no SKILL.md files. `com.kvond.answerable-publish` is loaded and running
on the Mac — do not disturb it.

## Not here — Google Drive

Decks and other artifacts. Drive is their source of truth. `.gitignore`
blocks .pptx, .gslides, and credentials.

## Retired

`~/Desktop/claude/katherine-ops` was merged into this repo and moved to
`~/skills_recon/`. Nothing was lost; every skill it held is either here
now or was already here identically.
