name: vt-fusion-retrofit
description: Diagnose an existing VT cycle deck for coordination work and propose a fusion slide for Katherine to accept or reject. Reads the deck, names the critical aspects it finds, judges whether those aspects can vary simultaneously and by what structure (stock-and-flow, compensatory pair, conflict case, or none), drafts one candidate slide plus its companion what-if, and stops. Never inserts a slide without approval. Diagnoses rather than inserts because a representation can be added to any cycle that accumulates while a case set has to be found in the content. Also drafts the teacher note slide for the cycle, with its seven declarations including which simultaneity the cycle works on and the visibility rung. Use when adding a fusion device to an existing deck, when auditing whether a cycle reaches coordination, when assigning visibility, or when building the fusion table across the arc. This skill does not build new decks — that is vt-deck-authoring. It does not finish decks to shipping standard — that is vt-bio-skill. Triggers - "fusion retrofit", "does this cycle fuse", "add a fusion slide", "fusion table", "coordination audit".

# vt-fusion-retrofit

Run this after `vt-bio-skill` has brought a deck to standard. Run it one deck at
a time, with Katherine present. It is not a batch job, and section 6 says why.

`deck_lint.py` remains the last gate.

## 1. Words

**Separation.** The student discerns a critical aspect as a thing that can vary,
because it varied while everything else was held still. This is what the 5 core
questions already do.

**Fusion.** The student holds two or more critical aspects at once, because the
case cannot be resolved from either alone.

Marton's underlying construct is **simultaneity**, and it comes in two forms:

- **Synchronic** — the aspects are present in the same case, in the same moment.
  This is fusion in the strict sense.
- **Diachronic** — things met at different times are brought into awareness
  together, so relations between them become discernible. The Concept Bank does
  this, and it is not a lesser thing. It is harder to engineer and most curricula
  never attempt it.

Both terms appear in teacher-facing material with a one-line gloss. **Neither
appears in anything a student reads** — the standing rule forbids coding
vocabulary to students.

## 2. The coordination structures

These are **not the same kind of object**, and the difference decides what can be
retrofitted. A representation can be *added* to any cycle whose content
accumulates. A case structure has to be *found* in the content and cannot be
manufactured.

**That distinction is the whole reason this skill diagnoses instead of inserting.**
If all three were representations, a rule could place them and a batch job could
run. Two of the three are not. A compensatory pair proposed into content that
holds no compensatory relationship, or a conflict case assembled out of two
examples that do not actually pull against each other, teaches a relationship that
is not there — and it teaches it with the authority of a slide. Carry this
distinction into every judgment below: for move 7 ask *does this content
accumulate*, and for moves 8 and 9 ask *is this already in the content*, which is
a different question with a different failure mode.

### 2a. One representation

**Stock-and-flow model.** A conditional slide type in `vt-bio-skill` §1; the form
comes from Moore-Anderson. The student reads or builds a model, and the
coordination is rate against amount — a stubborn confusion in its own right,
independent of biology content (Booth Sweeney and Sterman's bathtub studies found
graduate students failing it). Use only where the aspect turns on something that
accumulates.

### 2b. Two case structures

**Compensatory pair.** Two aspects vary inversely while the outcome is held
invariant, so neither aspect alone predicts the outcome. Use where the aspects
stand in an arithmetic relationship — a product or a sum.

*Worked example, ecology.* A sea turtle lays about a hundred eggs per clutch and
almost none reach breeding age. An elephant produces one calf every four or five
years and most survive. Both populations hold steady. Replacement rate is held
invariant; fecundity and per-offspring survival vary inversely. A student
reasoning from clutch size alone concludes the ocean should be solid turtles.
The error is not a knowledge gap — it is discerning one aspect and stopping.

*Worked example, physiology.* Cardiac output = heart rate × stroke volume.
Different combinations give the same output.

**Conflict case.** One case in which one aspect points toward one answer and a
second points toward another, so both must be coordinated to resolve it.

*Where it goes, decided by Katherine 2026-08-30:* **immediately after the Concept
Bank**, between the bank and the Day 3 divider. The bank puts the vocabulary in
front of the student without asking her to relate any of it - she is not ready
for that at that step. The conflict case is the next thing she meets, and it is
where the relating is asked for, on content rather than on vocabulary. This
supersedes section 3b's "the Concept Bank is the last slide above the divider"
in `vt-bio-skill`, which is annotated there. Use
where no arithmetic relationship exists — most of Biology, nearly all of
Forensics.

*Worked example.* Legless snakes. Limbs aid locomotion points one way;
fitness is context-dependent points the other. Neither alone settles it. This is
also a discriminating case for teleological reasoning, which is arguably
biology's central conceptual obstacle.

**None.** A legitimate outcome. Some aspects do not co-vary. Say so and record
the reason.

[Marker strings for the two case structures — proposed 2026-08-30, not yet
Katherine's decision. Section 7 of `vt-bio-skill` fixes an exact string for
Pattern break, Build a Rule, What if and Getting Started, and section 3b fixes
`CONCEPT BANK` for the bank. It fixes nothing for these two, which means a
script cannot find them and the slide index cannot name them. The suggestion is
the kickers `COMPENSATORY PAIR` and `CONFLICT CASE`, matching the `CONCEPT BANK`
pattern, with `CASE A` / `CASE B` — already named in the section 13.4 type scale
— as a fallback for the pair, since a pair carries two cases and a conflict case
carries one. `vt_standard_sweep.py` detects on those strings as of 2026-08-30.
If you want different strings, change them there and here together, or the index
will silently stop naming the slides again.]

### 2c. The what-if question — evidence, not occasion

A counterfactual asks the student to hold the case, change one aspect, and
generate the consequence. She cannot do that without already holding the relation
between aspects. So it does not create coordination; it reveals whether
coordination happened.

The compensatory pair and the conflict case are **occasions** for coordination.
The what-if is **evidence** of it, and it is visible in what she writes rather
than inferable from a score.

**So it is not an alternative to the three structures. It is a required companion
to whichever one the cycle carries.** Whenever this skill proposes a coordination
structure, it proposes the what-if in the same breath, and a proposal that arrives
without one is incomplete. A cycle that gets a conflict case and no what-if has
been given an occasion nobody will read.

[Open, and left open here: whether the what-if is a tenth move in its own right or
a companion to moves 7, 8 and 9. It is treated as a companion throughout this
file, on the grounds that it tests coordination rather than creating it. Katherine
has not settled it.]

Three constraints:

- **Specify what changes and what is held.** "What if there were no decomposers?"
  leaves the student not knowing how far to go or at what scale. Moore-Anderson's
  forms are constrained: how would X differ *in this other context*, or *if I
  changed it in this way*. An unconstrained counterfactual is the polar bear
  question again.
- **In biology, counterfactuals invite teleology back.** "What if snakes had kept
  their legs?" gives a student reaching for purpose an easy answer. Hold the
  mechanism fixed and vary the condition instead: what if the ancestral
  population had lived in open ground rather than in burrows. Same coordination
  demand, no invitation to purpose.
- **Written and individual.** Moves 8 and 9 may run as group work — the exposure
  is low and the coordination demand is high, which is a good pairing. A group
  product says nothing about who coordinated, so the what-if must be individual
  or the diagnosis is empty.

## 3. What the skill does, per deck

1. Read the deck. List the critical aspects, in order, as the deck itself
   states them.
2. For each aspect, and for the pair of aspects if the cycle has two, judge:
   can these vary at the same time in a real case?
3. If yes, name which of the three structures fits, and say why the other two do
   not. Say which kind of object you are proposing while you do it — a
   representation you are *adding* because the content accumulates, or a case set
   you are *reporting* because it is already in the content. If you cannot point
   at the cases in the deck or in the phenomenon, you are manufacturing, and the
   answer is "none".
4. If no, say so plainly and give the reason. Do not manufacture a device.
5. Draft **one** candidate slide, cloned from the matching template slide type,
   never built by hand. Design tokens per `vt-bio-skill` §13.
6. Draft the **companion what-if** for that structure — individual, written,
   naming what changes and what is held, mechanism fixed and condition varied
   (section 2c). It travels with the proposal, not after it.
7. Assign **visibility**: the ceiling for each move the proposal touches, and the
   rung this cycle actually operates at. Moves 8 and 9 may be group work; the
   what-if may not.
8. Draft the teacher note slide (section 5), all seven declarations.
9. **Stop.** Present all of it to Katherine. Insert nothing.

---

## 4. The design requirement on a fusion slide

The case must be **unresolvable from one aspect**. A task that merely invites
relating leaves an ambiguity in the diagnosis.

[Why this matters downstream: a student who states both aspects and does not
relate them may have coordinated fine and not understood that relating was being
asked for. That is a task-comprehension failure wearing a fusion failure's
clothes. Only a case that cannot be answered one-aspect-at-a-time tells the two
apart. This is a requirement on the slide, not on the rubric.]

---

## 5. The teacher note slide

**One slide, not speaker notes.** Speaker notes are invisible to the audience
this is written for, and scattered notes cannot be removed as a unit. One slide
can be deleted in a single action and the deck still runs.

Carries a marker string in the title, so `deck_lint.py` can require it and a
teacher can find every instance.

Contents:

- The **critical aspect** this cycle teaches, in plain words.
- What is held **invariant** across the examples, and the sentence saying the
  examples differ in one dimension on purpose.
- **What breaks if you substitute an example.** The load-bearing line for
  adopting teachers.
- **Position in the sequence** — what this cycle assumes has already been
  discerned, and what later cycle depends on it.
- **The slide-type map** — which slide types appear here, and which conditional
  ones were deliberately left out, and why.
- **Which simultaneity this cycle is working on** — synchronic, diachronic, or
  both.
- **The visibility rung** — what this cycle asks students to expose, and to whom.
  Name a rung on the ladder, and name what it is building toward: rung 1 written
  and seen only by the teacher, rung 2 written and shown to one assigned partner,
  rung 3 the teacher reads a wrong but productive answer aloud unattributed and
  uses it, rung 4 a student owns an answer aloud by private invitation, rung 5
  public simultaneous commitment — the vote. Write it the way a decision is
  written: *"visibility: written and private, building toward unattributed
  read-aloud."*

That is the whole list, and it is seven items. A note carrying six is missing one.

**What this skill drafts for the visibility line.** State the rung, and state the
per-move ceiling for the moves this cycle carries. The proposed coordination
structure sits at group; the what-if sits at written and individual; move 4 sits
at written and private, because the student's own rule breaks there. A cycle's
declared rung is the ceiling it operates *at*, which may be below what the moves
would bear.

[Why the rung is declared rather than simply chosen. A room at rung 1 or 2 shows
quiet students writing, which reads as low engagement against every walkthrough
rubric in use, and is the correct instruction for that room at that time. Written
into the note, that absence stops being an absence and becomes a stated design
decision. An observer can disagree with a decision. She cannot disagree with an
absence, because an absence looks like a failure. The declaration is the whole
mechanism — it costs one line and it is what makes the ladder survivable
institutionally.]

[Visibility and complexity are two scales on different clocks and should not be
locked together. A hands-up vote is *low* complexity — a forced binary — sitting
at the top of the visibility scale, which is why it fails in a room where a wrong
first answer is not yet safe. The two-tier response slide solves the commitment
half of the problem and routes around the exposure half, which is why it works
where a vote would freeze the room. If visibility rises monotonically across the
arc, the highest-exposure moves land on the highest-complexity content, which is
the worst pairing. Better: raise visibility across the year, reset it low within
each cycle.]

[The slide-type map makes the deck self-documenting. `deck_lint.py` reads the
declared map, then checks the deck contains what it declared.]

---

## 6. Why this is not a batch job

Two reasons, and the second is the more important.

**It cannot decide.** Existing decks already made coherent choices. A skill that
picks a fusion device by rule will insert compensatory pairs into cycles with no
compensatory relationship, and the undoing costs more than the building.

**The case file is the byproduct.** Every accept and reject Katherine makes while
running this across 26 decks is a documented decision, in her words, with the
content in view. The case file is not a separate writing task. It is the record
of this run. Capture the reason at the moment of the decision, not afterward.

---

## 7. Output per deck, for the fusion table

One row: cycle, critical aspects, synchronic device or none, reason for none,
diachronic device present, NGSS codes.

[The canonical row is the one above. If Katherine wants the what-if audited across
the arc — and the argument for it is that a required companion missing from half
the cycles is exactly the kind of thing a table exists to surface — it is one more
column, not a redesign. Not added unilaterally.]

The table across all 20 cycles is what makes a coverage hole visible, and it is
what a teacher needs to plan across weeks. A teacher cannot engineer diachronic
simultaneity without seeing the weeks at once — the same argument made for
students, applied to the person planning the year.

[An absence in the table is not automatically a hole. A standard addressed
without a fusion device, because the content carries no compensatory relationship
and no genuine conflict case, is a design decision. The table distinguishes the
two; it does not resolve them for you.]

[Open, and it is the reason the NGSS column is in the row at all: one standard is
suspected uncovered across the arc. Which one has not been named. Name it and it
can be checked directly against the table rather than argued about — until then
the column collects evidence for a question nobody has asked yet.]
